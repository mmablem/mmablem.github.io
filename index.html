	<P>This season has been anything but easy. With the frigid temperatures one week and the summer like days the next, the practices have been difficult but they have paid off. 
	Many games have been brutal with the extreme lows and howling winds but we were rewarded with a spring like game in early Feburary which gave us some hope. All of our players have put their blood, sweat and tears into this season and it shows. 
	With a winning season thus far, the fun has only begun but so has the hard work. A winning season is very rewarding but teamwork and friendship is the highlight of importance for this team. 
	Every player is an MVP in the minds of this team and we are all winners. As the playoffs are quickly approaching the team has been practicing everyday and focusing on their skills. A missed catch or a bad hit could really cost the team 
	a lot when it comes to a win or loss. The 3-0 record thus far is a motivation for the team to continue working hard and doing the best that they can. <i>Below you can click on the image of the softball and visit the UGA Intramural webiste.</i></P>
